# You should know that Docker Compose works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
services:
  # The name of our service is "database"
  # but you can use the name of your choice.
  # Note: This may change the commands you are going to use a little bit.
  postgres:
    # Official Postgres image from DockerHub (we use the last version)
    image: 'postgres:latest'

    # By default, a Postgres database is running on the 5432 port.
    # If we want to access the database from our computer (outside the container),
    # we must share the port with our computer's port.
    # The syntax is [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve in the container]
    # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are connecting to your database.
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

    # The `volumes` tag allows us to share a folder with our container
    # Its syntax is as follows: [folder path on our machine]:[folder path to retrieve in the container]
    volumes:
      # In this example, we share the folder `db-data` in our root repository, with the default PostgreSQL data path
      # It means that every time the repository is modifying the data inside
      # of `/var/lib/postgresql/data/`, automatically the change will appear in `db-data`
      # You don't need to create the `db-data` folder. Docker Compose will do it for you
      - ./db-data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
      # In this example, we share an init.sql script with the container
      # The init script will be executed when the database is first run
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
